Song Recommendation

Aim

To recommend similar songs given a particular song

Working

It invloves two parts

1) function to convert json format to a csv file->make_csv.R
2) Cluster formation -> make_cluster.R
3) find function to find similar songs -> find.R


1) Parsing JSON and converting it to a csv file
Note- For the following project this function was not used to get the csv file.The data was directely extracted from Qubole(It provides Big Data as a service).However the following function can be used to convert JSON file to a csv file. The function automatically elimnates bad JSON files through trycatch function.

2) Cluster formation

We use Kmeans clustering algorithm to group similar songs. The clustering algorithms use the metadata to group similar songs.
Appropriate no of clusters are decided to get minimum distance between songs.
We get cluster Id for each song. Same songs have same cluster Id.

3) find function

It takes a song as an input and gives similar songs based on same cluster ID
