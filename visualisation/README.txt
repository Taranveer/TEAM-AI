VISUALISATION DOCUMENTATION

GRAPH 1 :
The graph is a scatterplot between the "Loudness" (in dB) and the "Year" of release of the song.

The graph shows an increasing trend in the music loudness as the years move from past to present.

GRAPH 2 :
The graph is a histogram of the "Loudness" and the different colored bar depict the time ranges in which the observation falls in.

The time has been divided into three ranges from 1980-1990, 1991-1999 and 2000-2010 which are indicated by the colors red, green and blue respectively.

The histogram depicts an increasing number of loud songs across the time ranges from past to present.

GRAPH 3 :
The graph is a scatterplot between the "Song Hotness" and "Artist Familiarity" along with a linear regression line fitted into the observations.

The scatterplot along with the regression line clearly shows a positive trend between the "Song Hotness" and "Artist Familiarity".

GRAPH 4 :
The graph is a scatterplot between the "Tempo" and "Years" along with a smooth curve fitted into the observations.

The plot exhibits a spreading pattern as the years move towards the present. There is an increasing number of songs which have both high and low tempo.

Since the observations are distributed evenly the smooth curve resembles a straight line.

GRAPH 5 :
The graph is a histogram of the "Time Signature" of the songs along with different colored bars to depict the time range in which the observation falls in.

The time has been divided into three ranges from 1980-1990, 1991-1999 and 2000-2010 which are indicated by the colors red, green and blue respectively.

The no. of songs with the time signature of 4 is much greater than the other values.

GRAPH 6 :
The graph is a scatterplot between "Song Hotness" and "Artist Hotness" along with a linear regression line fitted into the observations.

The scatterplot along with the regression line clearly shows a positive trend between the "Song Hotness" and "Artist Hotness".
